  caveats <<~EOS
    This app is not code-signed, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it on
    first launch. Allow it with:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/LLM Ground Zero.app"

    The dashboard reads data set up by the llm-ground-zero CLI tooling.
    For shared agent memory and usage tracking, also run:
      git clone https://github.com/douglas-vaz/llm-ground-zero ~/llm-ground-zero
      cd ~/llm-ground-zero && ./setup.sh
  EOS
end
